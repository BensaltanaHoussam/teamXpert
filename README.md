## **User Stories**

### 1. **Position Players in Formation**
As a developer, I will enable the user to position players in the formation using a drag-and-drop system or a selection interface, making it easy to customize team setups.

### 2. **Create a Responsive Structure**
As a developer, I will create a basic HTML and CSS structure for the application and ensure it is responsive, so it adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

### 3. **Dynamic Player Form**
As a developer, I will create a dynamic form that allows the user to add players to the team by filling in necessary information such as name, position, and other relevant details.

### 4. **Limit to 11 Players**
As a developer, I will implement a strict limitation of 11 players in the main formation to ensure the game rules are followed.

### 5. **Modify Player Details**
As a developer, I will allow the user to modify a playerâ€™s details, such as changing their position or updating their information.

### 6. **Delete a Player**
As a developer, I will provide the user with the ability to remove a player from the formation easily.

### 7. **Deploy on GitHub Pages**
As a developer, I will deploy the application on GitHub Pages to make the project accessible to all users.
